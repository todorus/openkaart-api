And that's it. Docker will get any additional requirements and setup your development or testing environment.

Development
-----------
You can run the develop script to get you started. The script will build a Docker container and run it.
```

This will start a webserver and echo the hostname and port to the console. It will run any code contained within the "/code" directory.

Any changes inside the "/code" directory will be reflected in the webserver.
