# openkaart-api

The backend for the openkaart project. The api is provided by a collection of microservices. You can find these services under **app/{RESOURCE_NAME}**.

Each resource is treated as its own microproject within the api and will have its own README.MD file with instructions on how to develop, test and deploy the resource.
